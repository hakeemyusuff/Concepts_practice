# 🧠 Concept Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Concept Practice** repo — a personal vault where I break down and apply software engineering concepts I’m learning. This isn't about perfection or big projects; it’s about *deep understanding through hands-on practice*.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repo focuses on a core topic or concept. Inside, you'll find:

- 🔸 Simple implementations or code snippets
- 🔸 Personal notes written in my own words
- 🔸 Examples that help me understand and remember
- 🔸 (Sometimes) mistakes and retries — because that's how real learning happens

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far

- `TCP/` – Transmission Control Protocol: connection-based data transfer
- `UDP/` – User Datagram Protocol: fast, connectionless communication

More folders and concepts will be added as I continue my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Why This Repo?

This is where I slow down, take ownership of what I’m learning, and explain it like I’m teaching someone else, because if I can’t explain it simply, I don’t understand it well enough.

## 💡 Notes to Self

- Practice doesn’t need to be fancy — it just needs to be *real*.
- Understanding is more important than memorization.
- This repo grows with me.
